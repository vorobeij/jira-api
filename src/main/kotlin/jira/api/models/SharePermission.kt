/**
 * Details of a share permission for the filter.
 *
 * @param group, optional, The group that the filter is shared with. For a request, specify the `groupId` or `name` property for the group. As a group's name can change, use of `groupId` is recommended.
 * @param id, optional, The unique identifier of the share permission.
 * @param project, optional, The project that the filter is shared with. This is similar to the project object returned by [Get project](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-get) but it contains a subset of the properties, which are: `self`, `id`, `key`, `assigneeType`, `name`, `roles`, `avatarUrls`, `projectType`, `simplified`.
For a request, specify the `id` for the project.
 * @param role, optional, The project role that the filter is shared with.
For a request, specify the `id` for the role. You must also specify the `project` object and `id` for the project that the role is in.
 * @param type, required, The type of share permission:

 *  `user` Shared with a user.
 *  `group` Shared with a group. If set in a request, then specify `sharePermission.group` as well.
 *  `project` Shared with a project. If set in a request, then specify `sharePermission.project` as well.
 *  `projectRole` Share with a project role in a project. This value is not returned in responses. It is used in requests, where it needs to be specify with `projectId` and `projectRoleId`.
 *  `global` Shared globally. If set in a request, no other `sharePermission` properties need to be specified.
 *  `loggedin` Shared with all logged-in users. Note: This value is set in a request by specifying `authenticated` as the `type`.
 *  `project-unknown` Shared with a project that the user does not have access to. Cannot be set in a request.
 * @param user, optional, The user account ID that the filter is shared with. For a request, specify the `accountId` property for the user.
