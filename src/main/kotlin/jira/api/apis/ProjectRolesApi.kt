    ### About project roles ###

    [Project roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

    Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.

    #### Members and actors ####

    In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.

    Actors may be set as [default members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role) of the project role or set at the project level:

     *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
     *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

     * GET /rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/role/{id}
     *
     * Returns a project role's details and actors associated with the project. The list of actors is sorted by display name.

    To check whether a user belongs to a role based on their group memberships, use [Get user](#api-rest-api-3-user-get) with the `groups` expand parameter selected. Then check whether the user keys and groups match with the actors returned for the project.
