    If the user has no language preference set (which is the default setting) or this resource is accessed anonymous, the browser locale detected by Jira is returned. Jira detects the browser locale using the *Accept-Language* header in the request. However, if this doesn't match a locale available Jira, the site default locale is returned.

    This operation can be accessed anonymously.

    Note that these keys are deprecated:

     *  *jira.user.locale* The locale of the user. By default this is not set and the user takes the locale of the instance.
     *  *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default this is not set and the user takes the timezone of the instance.

    These system preferences keys will be deprecated by 15/07/2024. You can still retrieve these keys, but it will not have any impact on Notification behaviour.

     *  *user.notifications.watcher* Whether the user gets notified when they are watcher.
     *  *user.notifications.assignee* Whether the user gets notified when they are assignee.
     *  *user.notifications.reporter* Whether the user gets notified when they are reporter.
     *  *user.notifications.mentions* Whether the user gets notified when they are mentions.

    Use [ Update a user profile](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-management/rest/#api-users-account-id-manage-profile-patch) from the user management REST API to manage timezone and locale instead.

     **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.
