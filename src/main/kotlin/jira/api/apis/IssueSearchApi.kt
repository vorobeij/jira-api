     * @param jql A [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/egORLQ) expression. For performance reasons, this field requires a bounded query. A bounded query is a query with a search restriction.

     *  Example of an unbounded query: `order by key desc`.
     *  Example of a bounded query: `assignee = currentUser() order by key`. (optional) (example: project = HSP)
     * @param nextPageToken The token for a page to fetch that is not the first page. The first page has a `nextPageToken` of `null`. Use the `nextPageToken` to fetch the next page of issues. (optional) (example: <string>)
     * @param maxResults The maximum number of items to return. Depending on search criteria, real number of items returned may be smaller. It returns max 5000 issues. (optional) (example: 114)
     * @param fields A list of fields to return for each issue, use it to retrieve a subset of fields. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. Expand options include:

     *  `*all` Returns all fields.
     *  `*navigable` Returns navigable fields.
     *  `id` Returns only issue IDs.
     *  Any issue field, prefixed with a minus to exclude.

    The default is `id`.

    Examples:

     *  `summary,comment` Returns only the summary and comments fields only.
     *  `-description` Returns all navigable (default) fields except description.
     *  `*all,-comment` Returns all fields except comments.

    Multiple `fields` parameters can be included in a request.

    Note: By default, this resource returns IDs only. This differs from [GET issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get) where the default is all fields. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param expand Use [expand](#expansion) to include additional information about issues in the response. Note that, unlike the majority of instances where `expand` is specified, `expand` is defined as a list of values. The expand options are:

     *  `renderedFields` Returns field values rendered in HTML format.
     *  `names` Returns the display name of each field.
     *  `schema` Returns the schema describing a field type.
     *  `transitions` Returns all possible transitions for the issue.
     *  `operations` Returns all possible operations for the issue.
     *  `editmeta` Returns information about how each field can be edited.
     *  `changelog` Returns a list of recent updates to an issue, sorted by date, starting from the most recent.
     *  `versionedRepresentations` Instead of `fields`, returns `versionedRepresentations` a JSON array containing each version of a field's value, with the highest numbered item representing the most recent version. (optional) (example: <string>)
     * @param properties A list of up to 5 issue properties to include in the results. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param fieldsByKeys Reference fields by their key (rather than ID). The default is `false`. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param failFast Fail this request early if we can't retrieve all field data. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param reconcileIssues Strong consistency issue ids to be reconciled with search results. Accepts max 50 ids. All issues must exist. (optional) (example: null)

     *  If no JQL expression is provided, all issues are returned.
     *  `username` and `userkey` cannot be used as search terms due to privacy reasons. Use `accountId` instead.
     *  If a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required. (optional) (example: project = HSP)
     * @param startAt The index of the first item to return in a page of results (page offset). (optional) (example: null)
     * @param maxResults The maximum number of items to return per page. To manage page size, Jira may return fewer items per page where a large number of fields are requested. The greatest number of items returned per page is achieved when requesting `id` or `key` only. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param validateQuery Determines how to validate the JQL query and treat the validation results. Supported values are:

     *  `strict` Returns a 400 response code if any errors are found, along with a list of all errors (and warnings).
     *  `warn` Returns all errors as warnings.
     *  `none` No validation is performed.
     *  `true` *Deprecated* A legacy synonym for `strict`.
     *  `false` *Deprecated* A legacy synonym for `warn`.

    Note: If the JQL is not correctly formed a 400 response code is returned, regardless of the `validateQuery` value. (optional) (example: null)

     *  `-description` Returns all navigable (default) fields except description.
     *  `*all,-comment` Returns all fields except comments.

    This parameter may be specified multiple times. For example, `fields=field1,field2&fields=field3`.

    Note: All navigable fields are returned by default. This differs from [GET issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get) where the default is all fields. (optional) (example: null)

     *  `editmeta` Returns information about how each field can be edited.
     *  `changelog` Returns a list of recent updates to an issue, sorted by date, starting from the most recent.
     *  `versionedRepresentations` Instead of `fields`, returns `versionedRepresentations` a JSON array containing each version of a field's value, with the highest numbered item representing the most recent version. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param properties A list of issue property keys for issue properties to include in the results. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. Multiple properties can also be provided using an ampersand separated list. For example, `properties=prop1,prop2&properties=prop3`. A maximum of 5 issue property keys can be specified. (optional) (example: null)
     * @param fieldsByKeys Reference fields by their key (rather than ID). (optional) (example: null)
     * @param failFast Whether to fail the request quickly in case of an error while loading fields for an issue. For `failFast=true`, if one field fails, the entire operation fails. For `failFast=false`, the operation will continue even if a field fails. It will return a valid response, but without values for the failed field(s). (optional) (example: null)
