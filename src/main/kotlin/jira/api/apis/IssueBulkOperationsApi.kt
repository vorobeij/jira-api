     *
     * Use this API to retrieve a list of transitions available for the specified issues that can be used or bulk transition operations. You can submit either single or multiple issues in the query to obtain the available transitions.

    The response will provide the available transitions for issues, organized by their respective workflows. **Only the transitions that are common among the issues within that workflow and do not involve any additional field updates will be included.** For bulk transitions that require additional field updates, please utilise the Jira Cloud UI.

    You can request available transitions for up to 1,000 issues in a single operation. This API uses pagination to return responses, delivering 50 workflows at a time.

     * Use this API to submit a bulk issue move request. You can move multiple issues, but they must all be moved to and from a single project, issue type, and parent. You can't move more than 1000 issues (including subtasks) at once.

    #### Scenarios: ####

    This is an early version of the API and it doesn't have full feature parity with the Bulk Move UI experience.

     *  Moving issue of type A to issue of type B in the same project or a different project: `SUPPORTED`
     *  Moving multiple issues of type A in one project to multiple issues of type B in the same project or a different project: **`SUPPORTED`**
     *  Moving a standard parent issue of type A with its multiple subtask issue types in one project to standard issue of type B and multiple subtask issue types in the same project or a different project: `SUPPORTED`
     *  Moving an epic issue with its child issues to a different project without losing their relation: `NOT SUPPORTED`
    (Workaround: Move them individually and stitch the relationship back with the Bulk Edit API)

    #### Limits applied to bulk issue moves: ####

    When using the bulk move, keep in mind that there are limits on the number of issues and fields you can include.

     *  You can move up to 1,000 issues in a single operation, including any subtasks.
     *  All issues must originate from the same project and share the same issue type and parent.
     *  The total combined number of fields across all issues must not exceed 1,500,000. For example, if each issue includes 15,000 fields, then the maximum number of issues that can be moved is 100.
